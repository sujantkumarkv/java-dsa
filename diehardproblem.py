"""
The Die Hard Problem: 
You have a 5-gallon bucket and a 3-gallon bucket.
You have a pump that can fill either bucket with water.
You have a tap that can empty either bucket.
You have a sink that can empty both buckets.
You have to obtain a 4-gallon bucket.
How do you do it?

Its gonna use BFS, backtracking etc to find the exact path. 

Yet to be done and updated.
